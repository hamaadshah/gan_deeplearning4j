    "The purpose of deep learning is to learn a representation of high dimensional and noisy data using a sequence of differentiable functions, i.e., geometric transformations, that can perhaps be used for supervised learning tasks among others. It has had great success in discriminative models while generative models have fared worse due to the limitations of explicit maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Adversarial learning as presented in the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) aims to overcome these problems by using implicit MLE. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the MNIST computer vision dataset for these experiments. GAN is a remarkably different method of learning compared to explicit MLE. Our purpose will be to show that the representation learnt by a GAN in an unsupervised manner can be used for supervised learning tasks. Unlabelled data is inexpensive to obtain in large quantities therefore training a feature extractor in an unsupervised manner is a powerful first step towards later training supervised learning models which perhaps may not have access to a large amount of labelled data."

    "We have shown how to use GANs to learn a good representation of raw data, i.e., 1 or 2 dimensional tensors per unit of analysis, that can then perhaps be used for supervised learning tasks in the domain of computer vision. This moves us away from manual handcrafted feature engineering towards automatic feature engineering, i.e., representation learning."
